## Brand Concept

Studio Merpati embodies creativity, warmth, and innovation, now infused with Swiss Design principles. Our brand aims to inspire and nurture artistic expression while providing a clean, functional, and user-friendly platform for digital creators.

## Swiss Design Principles

We incorporate the following Swiss Design principles:

1. Simplicity and minimalism
2. Clarity and legibility
3. Grid-based layouts
4. Asymmetrical balance
5. Typography focus (sans-serif)
6. Ample white space
7. Objective imagery

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors

- Living Coral (#FF6F61) - Our signature color, representing warmth and creativity
- Dark Gray (#333333) - For text and UI elements
- Off-White (#F5F5F5) - For backgrounds, reducing eye strain

### Secondary Colors

- Soft Teal (#4ECDC4) - Complementing Living Coral, adding a cool balance
- Warm Sand (#F7E8D5) - For subtle accents
- Deep Navy (#2C3E50) - For depth and sophistication

### Color Usage Guidelines

- Use a limited, purposeful color palette in line with Swiss Design principles
- Employ color for emphasis and navigation
- Maintain proper contrast ratios for accessibility:
  - Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text
  - Minimum 3:1 for large text (18pt or 14pt bold)
- Use Living Coral sparingly as an accent color
- Implement off-white backgrounds to reduce eye strain while maintaining clarity

## Typography

### Primary Font

- Helvetica Neue for headings and UI elements
  - Chosen for its Swiss origins and clean, modern aesthetic

### Secondary Font

  - Optimized for legibility in various sizes and formats

### Typography Guidelines

- Prioritize legibility with sans-serif fonts
- Use font size and weight for hierarchy and emphasis
- Implement fluid typography for responsiveness
- Maintain high contrast between text and background

## Grid System

- Implement a responsive 12-column grid for structure and consistency
- Use the grid to create visual hierarchy and ensure consistency across devices
- Apply asymmetrical balance in layouts for visual interest
- Divide the interface into clear sections (e.g., controls on the left, content on the right)

## White Space

- Embrace negative space for clarity and focus
- Use white space to guide user attention and create breathing room between elements
- Implement a clean, uncluttered layout for ease of navigation

## Imagery Style

1. Use high-quality, objective photography over illustrations
2. Incorporate a mix of artistic and technological themes
3. Utilize imagery that represents diversity in art forms and creators
4. Ensure images align with the grid system and respect white space

## Logo

- Simplify the dove (merpati) symbol to align with Swiss Design aesthetics
- Use Helvetica Neue for the wordmark "Studio Merpati"
- Design variations for different applications (full color, monochrome, etc.)
- Ensure the logo works well in various sizes and contexts

## UI Design Principles

1. Implement both dark and light modes with clear contrast
2. Use Living Coral sparingly as an accent color for important UI elements
3. Apply the grid system consistently across all interfaces
4. Create asymmetrical layouts that guide the user's eye
5. Incorporate subtle micro-interactions and transitions for engagement
6. Design gallery and portfolio pages with clear visual separation and easy-to-browse layouts
7. Use progressive disclosure techniques to manage complex information

## Interactive Elements

1. Design clear, minimalist controls (sliders, dropdowns, toggles)
2. Implement smooth transitions between states
3. Create interactive data visualizations for user statistics
4. Use haptic feedback subtly to enhance the tactile experience
5. Ensure all interactive elements are easily discoverable and intuitive

## Generative Art Creator Interface

1. Divide the interface into a control panel (left) and preview area (right)
2. Use sliders for adjustable parameters (e.g., complexity)
3. Implement color pickers with hex code input for precise control
4. Provide dropdown menus for selecting art styles or presets
5. Include clear call-to-action buttons (e.g., "New Seed", "Download")
6. Display real-time previews of generated artwork
7. Incorporate a toggle for auto-generation features

## Brand Voice and Tone

- Clear and concise, aligning with Swiss Design's emphasis on clarity
- Professional yet approachable
- Use language that empowers artists and creators
- Avoid unnecessary embellishments in communication

## Accessibility

1. Ensure all color combinations meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for contrast
2. Provide alternative text for images and icons
3. Design interfaces that are navigable by keyboard and screen readers
4. Test all products and materials for accessibility compliance

## Application in Marketing

1. Use the grid system for organizing content in marketing materials
2. Balance text and imagery to create visually striking, asymmetrical compositions
3. Incorporate the tagline "Create, Inspire, Simplify" in key visuals
4. Use ample white space in all marketing materials
